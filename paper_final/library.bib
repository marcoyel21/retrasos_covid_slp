abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and information on risk factors for worse prognosis is needed to accurately identify patients at risk and potentially provide insight into therapeutic options. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, including 3703 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, we identified risk factors associated with all-cause mortality, need for hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Male gender was independently associated with increased risk of hospitalization (Adjusted Odds Ratio (ORadj : 1.62 (95{\%} Confidence Interval (95{\%} CI): 1.38- 1.91)), mechanical ventilation (ORadj : 1.35 (95{\%} CI: 1.08- 1.69)) and death (ORadj : 1.46 (95{\%} CI: 1.17- 1.82)). Patients {\textgreater} 60 years had higher risk of hospitalization (ORadj : 5.47 (95{\%} CI: 4.29- 6.96)), mechanical ventilation (ORadj : 3.26 (95{\%} CI: 2.08- 5.11)) and death (ORadj : 13.04 (95{\%} CI: 6.25- 27.24)). Congestive heart failure (ORadj : 1.47 (95{\%} CI: 1.06- 2.02)) and dementia (ORadj : 2.03 (95{\%} CI: 1.46- 2.83)) were associated with increased odds of death, as well as the presence of more than two comorbidities (ORadj : 1.90 (95{\%} CI: 1.35- 2.68)). CONCLUSION COVID-19 patients of older age, male gender or having more than two comorbidities are at higher risk of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and death, and should therefore be closely monitored.

abstract = {Governments often provide inconsistent guidance to the public. Does inconsistency affect how much people believe the latest recommendations? Using an incentivized online experiment with 1,900 US respondents in early April 2020, we present all participants with the latest official projection about coron-avirus death counts. We randomize exposure to information that highlights the government's inconsistency about the coronavirus threat. When inconsistency is salient, participants have reduced propensity to revise prior beliefs about death counts and lower self-reported trust in the government. These results align with a simple model of signal extraction from government communication, and have implications for the design of changing guidelines in other settings.},

@techreport{Solis2020,
abstract = {As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of 6.76{\%}. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67{\%}. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on cross-sectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38{\%} (95{\%} CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59{\%}) and individuals with comorbidities (38{\%}-168{\%}, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

abstract = {Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019. However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. Objective: To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed. Results: A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7{\%}) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3{\%}]), cough (144 [34.6{\%}]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1{\%}]). A total of 82 patients (19.7{\%}) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P {\textless}.001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8{\%}] vs 78 of 334 [23.4{\%}]; P {\textless}.001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/$\mu$L) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] $\mu$g/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs {\textless}0.006 [{\textless}0.006-0.009] $\mu$g/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6{\%}] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5{\%}]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3{\%}] vs 13 of 334 [3.9{\%}]; P {\textless}.001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0{\%}] vs 14 of 334 [4.2{\%}]; P {\textless}.001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5{\%}] vs 49 of 334 [14.7{\%}]; P {\textless}.001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5{\%}] vs 1 of 334 [0.3{\%}]; P {\textless}.001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9{\%}] vs 17 of 334 [5.1{\%}]; P =.003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4{\%}] vs 16 of 334 [4.8{\%}]; P =.01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3{\%}] vs 6 of 334 [1.8{\%}]; P =.02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2{\%}] vs 15 of 334 [4.5{\%}]; P {\textless}.001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95{\%} CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95{\%} CI, 1.62-7.16]). Conclusions and Relevance: Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality..},

@article{Simonov2020,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
